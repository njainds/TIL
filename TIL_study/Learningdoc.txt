Sklearn in Python:
1. Logistic Regression:
Sklearn doesn't show wald chisquare, p vaues and confidence intervals hence couln;t select features based on model output
ALso it doesn't have forward/backward selection algorithms

In order to do feature selection for LR in sklearn:
1. Either use RF - put all features and do rank order of features
2. Randomised feature elimination: start with all fea and remove features one by one based on deviance reduction
3. Chisquare- get p values for chi squae test of indepence bw each feature and the target variable (Univariate)

Finally choose model based on CV score on accuracy or AUC

Signs of the coefficients might change due to multi collinearity.
