Introduction:
 I have overall 5 years of experience working in Data science and I have done my bachelors in engineering from IIT Patna in year 2012.
Currently I am working as Data scientist at Times Internet. Times Internet is the digital arm of entire times group and within Times Internet I work pecifically for the news business.
Here I am setting up the Data science practise from screatch. I joined in Jan and since then I've set up entire infrastructure for storing and processing big data in a distributed fashion.
enabling Business to use this vast data for decision making. I have built various automated reporting systems with visualisation to monitor key metrics like retention,engagement, Segemnt profile,
Behavioural cohort analysis and so on. This is being used by Business teams to measure product prerformance, optimise campaigns, build retention startegy.

Currently I am working on building user personalisation on mobile App. for eg. recommending News articles to users based on the article customer is reading or has read historically,
Recommend top News publications based on user attributes for New user.

Predicting customer churn based on clickstream behaviour on App.

Before that I worked at MakemyTrip, there I worked on customer liefecycle management related products like predicting customer's propensity to buy a product, customer churn predction, LTV caculation,
Identifying cross-sell opportunities, recommmending products, identifying relevant offers.

I worked on end to end implementation of the data science projects and measuring performance, iterate and optimise performance.
